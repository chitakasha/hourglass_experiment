# QML droplet: Quantum Machine Learning
# This droplet applies quantum algorithms and techniques to machine learning tasks, such as classification, clustering, regression, and reinforcement learning.
# This droplet can enhance the performance, accuracy, and scalability of machine learning models and enable new possibilities for data analysis and artificial intelligence.
# This droplet also implements an innovative approach to vocabularies and alphabets, where it uses infinity-based variables to get the most probable next element from an infinite alphabet, using Wikipedia as the external knowledge base and pre-trained vocabulary.
