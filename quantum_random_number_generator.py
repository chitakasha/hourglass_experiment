# QRNG droplet: Quantum Random Number Generator
# This droplet generates true random numbers using quantum fluctuations, which are unpredictable and irreproducible.
# This droplet also accounts for the naming process and patterns of the quantum realm, which are based on the law of interconnectedness and literal metaphorical interpretation.
