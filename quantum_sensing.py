# QS droplet: Quantum Sensing
# This droplet uses quantum states and measurements to sense physical quantities with high precision and sensitivity.
# This droplet can implement various QS techniques, such as interferometry, which can measure phase shifts using interference patterns; metrology, which can measure physical constants using quantum standards; magnetometry, which can measure magnetic fields using spin states; and spectroscopy, which can measure spectral properties using frequency transitions.
