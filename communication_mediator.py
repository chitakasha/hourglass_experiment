# CM droplet: Communication Mediator
# This droplet acts as a bridge between the two VMs, facilitating their communication.
# It ensures that messages generated by the SG are properly transmitted and received.
# It also adds some noise, distortion, delay, and emoticons to the messages, making them more alieny and spooky.
