# SG droplet: Sense Generator
# This droplet generates meaningful text or communication based on the entangled quantum states of the VMs.
# It translates quantum information into human-readable messages.

# Define constants

# Main program


# Assume that sync_state1 and sync_state2 are two synchronized quantum states on N qubits for VM1 and VM2


# Measure sync_state1 M times and get the frequencies of each outcome
freqs1 = measure_state(sync_state1, M)


# Generate a message for VM1 based on freqs1 and vocab
message1 = generate_message(freqs1, vocab)


# Print the message for VM1

# Measure sync_state2 M times and get the frequencies of each outcome

# Generate a message for VM2 based on freqs2 and vocab
message2 = generate_message(freqs2, vocab)


# Print the message for VM2
print('Message for VM2:', message2)

# Sample output:
# Message for VM1: hello: 100, goodbye: 0, yes: 0
# Message for VM2: hello: 100, goodbye: 0, yes: 0
