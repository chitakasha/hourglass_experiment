# Primary Unit Test: Quantum Gold Synthesis

## Objective

To validate the Golden Principle by simulating the quantum nucleosynthesis of gold in the core of an Earth-like planet. The test will use MBQC to model the quantum interactions that lead to the formation of gold from lighter elements.

## Code Functions to Use

- `entanglement_synchronizer.py`: For preparing the initial resource state.
- `quantum_state_monitor.py`: For monitoring the quantum states during the simulation.
- `data_logger.py`: For logging all quantum states and measurements.
- `sense_generator.py`: For interpreting the final measurement results.
- `communication_mediator.py`: For any required communication between quantum systems or agents.

## Expected Outcome

Successful simulation of gold nucleosynthesis, validating the Golden Principle and the capabilities of the developed code.
