# QL droplet: Quantum Logic
# This droplet uses quantum operators and gates to perform logical operations on qubits, such as NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, etc.
# This droplet can implement various QL circuits, such as half-adder, full-adder, multiplier, comparator, etc., which can perform arithmetic and binary operations on qubits.
