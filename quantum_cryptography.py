# QC droplet: Quantum Cryptography
# This droplet uses quantum principles to secure communication and information exchange.
# This droplet implements quantum key distribution (QKD), which allows two parties to share a secret key that is immune to eavesdropping, and quantum digital signatures (QDS), which allow one party to sign a message that can be verified by multiple recipients without revealing the signature.
# This droplet marks sensitive algorithms in the comments with a secret emoji symbol, i!.
